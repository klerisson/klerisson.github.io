abstract = {Social recommender systems assume a social network among users and make recommendations based on ratings of users that hold a relationship with a given user. However, explicit user’s ratings suffer from loss of information. One way to deal with such problem is mining preferences from user’s ratings. Even though, for a new user, a preference recommender system also needs techniques to provide accurate recommendations. In this paper, we present Social PrefRec, a social pairwise preference recommender system based on Preference Mining techniques. We focus on leveraging social information on pairwise preference recommender system, corroborating with the idea that matching new people with existing similar people help on providing accurate recommendations. Remark that our approach makes use of social information only on recommendation phase to select among existent recommendation models the most appropriate for a new user. In addition, this is the first step towards a general framework to incorporate social information in traditional approaches, improving upon the state-of-art in this context. We test this idea against two real data sets from Facebook and Flixster. We contribute to this line of work in three ways: (1) Social PrefRec, a social framework for pairwise preference recommender system; (2) a strategy for recommending items based on social metrics; (3) Two publicly available data set of item ratings with social information. For cold start users, the empirical analisys demonstrates that Social PrefRec reaches nDCG@10 equals to 0.9869.}
